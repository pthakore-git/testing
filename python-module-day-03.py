# # 3.3 A Deeper Dive Into Python - üêç

# # Activity 01 - Student Turn - Cereal Cleaner - üë©‚Äçüéìüë®‚Äçüéì 
# 
# In this activity, you will create an application that reads in cereal data from a CSV file and then prints only those cereals that contain 5 or more grams of fiber.
# 
# ## Instructions
# 
# * Read the file using the code in the notebook, `cereal.csv` and start by skipping the header row. See hints below for this.
# 
# * Read through the remaining rows and find the cereals that contain five grams of fiber or more, printing the data from those rows to the terminal.
# 
# ## Hints
# 
# * Every value within the csv is stored as a string, and certain values have a decimal. This means that they will have to be cast to be used.
# 
# * `csv.reader` begins reading the CSV file from the first row. `next(csv_reader, None)` will skip the header row.
# 
#   * Refer to this Stack Overflow post on [how to skip the header](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14257599) for more information.
# 
# * Integers in Python are whole numbers and, as such, cannot contain decimals. Decimal numbers As such, your numbers containing decimal points will have to be cast as a `float`.
# 
# ## Bonus
# 
# Try the activity again, but this time use `cereal_bonus.csv`, which does not include a header.

# ## Instructions
# 
# * Fill the cell below.
# 
# * Run the provided program. Note that nothing forces you to write the name properly in title case&mdash;for example, as "Jane" instead of "jAnE". You will use list comprehensions to fix this.
# 
#   * First, use list comprehensions to create a new list that contains the lowercase version of each of the names your user provided.
# 
#   * Then, use list comprehensions to create a new list that contains the title-case versions of each of the names in your lowercase list.
# 
# ## Hint
# 
# * Check out the documentation for the [title method](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.title).

# # Activity 08 - Student Turn - Graduation - üë©‚Äçüéìüë®‚Äçüéì
# 

# # Graduating Functions
# 
# In this activity, you will create a function that searches a list of students and graduates by state to determine state graduation rates for public, private nonprofit, and private for-profit institutions.
# 
# ## Instructions
# 
# * Analyze the code and CSV provided, looking specifically for what needs to still be added to the application.
# 
# * Using the starter code provided, create a function called `print_percentages` which takes in a parameter called `state_data` and does the following:
# 
#   * Uses the data stored within `state_data` to calculate the estimated graduation rates in each category of Title IV 4-year institutions (public, non-profit private, and for-profit private).
# 
#   * Prints out the graduation rates for each school type for the state to the terminal.
# 
# Note: Some states do not have non-profit or for-profit private schools, so data must be checked for zeros
# 
# ## Bonus
# 
# * Still within the `print_percentages()` function, calculate the overall graduation rate, and create a conditional that checks a state's overall graduation rate and prints either "Graduation success" to the screen if the number was greater than fifty or "State needs improvement" if the number was less than 50.

# * You only added files using the GitHub website, which works well enough when just dealing with one or two files. What happens when we need to quickly add multiple files?
# 
#   * The command line comes to the rescue!
# 
# * Creating a repo and adding files with Terminal/Git Bash.
# 
#   * First, create a new repo.
# 
#   * From the repo page, click the green box in the top-right labeled "Clone or download", select "Use SSH", and copy the link to the clipboard, as captured in the following GIF:
# 
#   ![clone repo](./images/GitClone.gif)
# 
#   * Open Terminal (or Git Bash for Windows users), and navigate to the home folder using `cd ~`.
# 
#   * Type `git clone <repository link>` in the terminal to clone the repo to the current directory. Once this code has run, everyone should find a folder with the same name as the repo, as captured in the following image:
#
